                                box model 
- by default the elements box-sizing property has the value content-box. It means that when we set width 200px and padding 30px the total width will be 260px
  ,so its better to set global style to the document elements to have box-sizing:border-box to include both content and padding dimensions.
- display: block, inline, inline-block, none.
- Inline elements do not have an explicit width; their size is determined by their content.
  They cannot accept width or height properties., unlike the block elements which have width: auto by default, which usually makes them stretch to 100% of their container. 
  img element is inline despite it has width and height properties to be set that's because they control the content size not the container box itself.
- some elements have default margin and padding properties so we set them to 0 with a global selector '*' when we want to reset them manually later.
                               
                                 position
- the default position of html elements is 'static'
- element with position: relative is offset (top, right, bottom, left) relative to its original position.
- an element with position: absolute is positioned relative to the nearest ancestor with a position other than static.
  If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (viewport).
- position: sticky often used with the header nav-bar to stick to the page upper limit while scrolling. to work muse set one of(top, bottom) dimension where the element will stick.

                                  flex box
*parent container styles:                                 
- display-> flex
- flex-direction-> column, row, column-reverse, row-reverse  (set the main and cross axis, the reverse part reverse both the items order and end-start)
- flex-wrap-> nowrap(default), wrap
- flex-flow shorthand-> flex-direction flex-wrap;
- align-items-> stretch, baseline, center, flex-start, flex-end  (work on the cross axis)
- align-content-> stretch, center, flex-start, flex-end, space-between,evenly,around (set how multiple lines are spaced apart from each other)
- justify-content-> space-between, space-around, space-evenly, center, flex-start, flex-end  (work on the main axis)

*children items styles:
- flex-grow: control how the item will grow relatively to the available width space from its container (appear with big width container)
- flex-shrink: control how the items will shrink to make the the total items match the available space from the container. (works when total items exceed container width, especially with flex-wrap:nowrap prop)
- flex-basis: acts as the width property
- align-self: flex-start, flex-end, center  (differ from align-items in that it aligns individual item with limited available values)
- flex shorthand: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis
- order: the default value is 0. items with custom lower order(-1) comes first and vice versa.

- semantic elements (header, footer, main, aside, section) used for SEO.
